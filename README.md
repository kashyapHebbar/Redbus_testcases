# Redbud Test Automation Suite

This project contains automated test cases for the Redbud application, implemented using Cucumber, Selenium, TestNG, JUnit, and Maven.

## Overview

Our test suite covers a variety of scenarios in the Redbud application, from selecting and searching functionalities, to clicking actions, bookings, sorting, and more. This suite is built to ensure each module of the application is thoroughly validated for accuracy, functionality, and reliability.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Cucumber - for Behavior Driven Development
* Selenium WebDriver - for automating browser activities
* TestNG - for enhanced test structure, grouping and parallel test execution
* JUnit - for assertions and test management
* Maven - for project build and dependency management

## Installation & Usage
